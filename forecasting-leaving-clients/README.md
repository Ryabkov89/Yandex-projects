Customers began to leave the bank. Every month. A little, but noticeable. Bank marketers have calculated that it is cheaper to retain current customers than to attract new ones.
It is necessary to predict whether the client will leave the bank in the near future or not. Historical data on the behavior of customers and termination of contracts with the bank are presented.

## Conclusion
Research was conducted to identify the most adequate machine learning model. The aim of the study has been achieved - the best model is a "Random Forest" with 40 trees and a depth of study of 12 when training the model on an enlarged sample. Relatively randomly, our model showed a good result, which is reflected in the graph above, the area under the curve is 0.85, surpassing the random model by more than one and a half times.
