## Conclusion
Research was conducted to identify the most adequate machine learning model. The aim of the study has been achieved - the best model is a "Random Forest" with 40 trees and a depth of study of 12 when training the model on an enlarged sample. Relatively randomly, our model showed a good result, which is reflected in the graph above, the area under the curve is 0.85, surpassing the random model by more than one and a half times.
