# Planning a game sales for next year

## Project description.
We have at our disposal data on game sales, user and expert ratings, genres and platforms for the period from 1980 to 2016. It is necessary to identify patterns that determine the success of the game in order to identify the most potentially hit products and plan advertising campaigns.
## Tools and technologies
* pandas
* nympy
* matplotlib
* scipy
  
## Conclusion
In general, the result of the study was the obvious fact that the recently released PS4 and Xbox One platforms are the option that is worth betting on, especially for sales in the USA and Europe, and for the JP region, the Nintendo 3DS console will be a great addition, taking almost half of the sales of all games in the region. It is recommended to pay attention to the reviews of critics and expect better sales from games with the best ratings and not to jump to conclusions based on user reviews.
